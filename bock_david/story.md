The Fluffy Bunny and the Squeaky Gate

Once upon a time there was a fluffy little bunny named Carl.  Carl was an adventurous bunny, and liked to wander far from home.
  
One day he saw some delicious carrots growing in a stranger's yard.  "I'm gonna go eat those carrots!", Carl said to himself.

So carl snuck up the path, slowly opened the gate, and then rushed to the carrots as fast as he could.  He wasn't half-way to the carrots when he heard a sound unlike anything he'd ever heard before.  **"SQUEEK!"** went the sound.  Carl froze, fearing a bird overhead.  **"SQUEEK!"** it went again.  he ran to the nearest bush and hid.

The carrots were close, but there was no overhead protection.  He wanted those carrots, but he was afraid.  He hid under the bush for an hour, and was beginning to think the coast was clear.

**SQUEEK!** went the sound again.  **SQUEEK!  BANG!**

Just then, a human came walking up the path.  He didn't know what to do!  He couldn't get the carrots, and he couldn't run home!
