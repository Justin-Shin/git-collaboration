The Homeless Turtle and a Streetcar Named Covfefe

Once upon a time there was a turtle that lived in a covfefe city after a major war. The turtle was supposed to marry another turtle, but something happened (I think the other turtle might have been poor or something) so the turtle decided to move out and be homeless in a hotel somewhere.

The homeless turtle had a (looking back on it, toxic) bff and they spent their time drinking and stuff. At some point the homeless turtle meets another turtle on a streetcar (you can guess the name) and they might fall in love, I dunno I didn't actually read the book. I assume they all die in the end (presumably in previously mentioned streetcar) because the source material is listed as a tragedy.

The End.
