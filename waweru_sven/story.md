"The Friendly Baby Tiger and the Squishy Bouncy Ball"

One time in band camp there was a fluffy baby tiger named [redacted]. The fluffy baby tiger liked to play with his favorite squishy ball after practicing his oboe. One day after practicing his oboe the fluffy baby tiger could not find his squishy bouncy ball to play with. This made him sad. The fluffy baby tiger went on a journey to find his squishy bouncy ball.

First he came across his friend, the white dog named Brian. "Do you know where my squishy bouncy ball is", asked the fluffy baby tiger. "No", said Brian, "but I think I saw slithery snake named Donald rolling something down the hill near the lake."

The fluffy baby tiger went down the hill to the lake where he found the slithery snake playing with his squishy bouncy ball. "Hey, that's my squishy bouncy ball", exclaimed the fluffy baby tiger.

"Well I stole it fair and so I've elected to keep it." "It's mine now", said the slithery snake.
