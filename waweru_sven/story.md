"The Friendly Baby Tiger and the Squishy Bouncy Ball"

One time in band camp there was a fluffy baby tiger named [redacted]. The fluffy baby tiger liked to play with his favorite squishy ball after practicing his oboe. One day after practicing his oboe the fluffy baby tiger could not find his squishy bouncy ball to play with. This made him sad. The fluffy baby tiger went on a journey to find his squishy bouncy ball.

First he came across his friend, the white dog named Brian. "Do you know where my squishy bouncy ball is", asked the fluffy baby tiger. "No", said Brian, "but I think I saw slithery snake named Donald rolling something down the hill near the lake."

The fluffy baby tiger went down the hill to the lake where he found the slithery snake playing with his squishy bouncy ball. "Hey, that's my squishy bouncy ball", exclaimed the fluffy baby tiger.

"Well I stole it fair and so I've elected to keep it." "It's mine now", said the slithery snake.

The fluffy baby tiger didn't know what to do.

Suddenly, the fluffy baby tiger remembered that he just learned how to play the snake charmer song on his oboe at camp today. The sheet music to this song had been lost a little more than 100 days ago but was somehow leaked from its secret hidden place. Conveniently having his oboe with him in his bag, the fluffy baby tiger took out his oboe and began to play the snake charmer song. The slithery snake could not resist the allure of the song and began to slither to the sound of the song loosening his grip on the ball.

At that point, the fluffy baby tiger took out the wicker basket he also conveniently had in his basket, scooped the slithery snake named Donald into it and placed the basket top on it. The fluffy baby tiger was very happy that he just so happened to carry his oboe and the wicker basket with him on his journey. The fluffy baby tiger, having now returned to his normal daily schedule, began to play with his squishy bouncy ball and lived happily ever after.

The End.

Moral of the story: Sometimes, life will grab you by the [redacted], but then there will be some conveniently placed tools and leaks to help you alleviate the pressure and issue.
