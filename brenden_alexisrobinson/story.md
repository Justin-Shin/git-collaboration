The lazy sloth fell out of bed. Luckily for him he didn't hit his head. He landed on his fluffy butt instead! 
Now with our lazy protagonist out of his stupor he realized its late, why its time for _supper_!
He slowly walks to the to the kitchen table, to see whats left over for him to munch.
He looks in the fridge to make his tummy stable, he sees some left-overs from his lunch.

He took out his food that wasn't to old, and put it in the stove so it won't be so cold!
He wanted his food fast before his night flew by so he turned up the heat all the way to high.
To boread to stand around the sloth climbed into the sink, he figured he had time to catch 40 winks.
