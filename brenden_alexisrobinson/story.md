The lazy sloth fell out of bed. Luckily for him he didn't hit his head. He landed on his fluffy butt instead! 
Now with our lazy protagonist out of his stupor he realized its late, why its time for _supper_!
He slowly walks to the to the kitchen table, to see whats left over for him to munch.
He looks in the fridge to make his tummy stable, he sees some left-overs from his lunch.
