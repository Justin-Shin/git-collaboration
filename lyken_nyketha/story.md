Anna-May and the Giant.

Anna-May saves her village from the horrid tyrant:

Anna-May and Pepe, the pig set out on a world wind adventure to defeat the Giant who has been causing chaos in her village.

====
One day, Anna-May and Pepe went to arrived to the water well to fetch water for mother who needed to make breakfast and give baby brother, Phillip a bath before heading out to work.

Upon arrival there was a grumpy giant, waving his arms and stomping on Mr.Baker's Bakery shop, screaming, **"I want my cookies, where are my cookies, give it to me!"**

Poor Mr. Baker looked distraught as he ran away from the scene of the incident, yelling at Anna-May to do the same, as it wasn't safe for little girls and their trusty pigs to be in the presence of an angry, hungry giant.

Anna-May and Pepe ran home to tell Mother about what they had witnessed and explained why they will not be having breakfast anytime soon or why little Phillip will remain filthy.

Mother looked terrified and was worried about what will become of them and whether or not their village will ever be safe for her and her children and Pepe, the pig.
