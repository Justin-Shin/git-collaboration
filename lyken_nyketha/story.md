One day, Anna-May and Pepe went to arrived to the water well to fetch water for mother who needed to make breakfast and give baby brother, Phillip a bath before heading out to work.

Upon arrival there was a grumpy giant, waving his arms and stomping on Mr.Baker's Bakery shop, screaming, **"I want my cookies, where are my cookies, give it to me!"**

Poor Mr. Baker looked distraught as he ran away from the scene of the incident, yelling at Anna-May to do the same, as it wasn't safe for little girls and their trusty pigs to be in the presence of an angry, hungry giant.

Anna-May and Pepe ran home to tell Mother about what they had witnessed and explained why they will not be having breakfast anytime soon or why little Phillip will remain filthy.

Mother looked terrified and was worried about what will become of them and whether or not their village will ever be safe for her and her children and Pepe, the pig.

Anna-May turned to her mother and said **"This is NOT RIGHT, this is NOT FAIR, we have to DO something!"**

Mother looked at Anna-May and said, **"sweetie there is nothing we can really do, it is not safe for us, we must hide until we can escape from this place"**

Anna-May, distraught and determined turned to Pepe and said **"NO! we're going to do something about this, but let's not worry mother"** Packing a her haversack of snacks and gadgets, she kissed little Phillip good-bye and snuck out the house while Mother talked to Father on the phone.

Upon arrival the scene of the grumpy, hungry, clumsy giant ...
