Believe me folks, he is the best, he is the greatest writer, he's fantastic.  Listen, you know it, I know it, we all know it, his spelling is on point, and he is truly a once in a generation mind.  Terrific.  Other people might say they are better, but believe me folks, they are low-energy losers.  Nasty Natasha, for example cant get close to his ability. Sad!
