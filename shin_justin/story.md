The Prickly Polar Bear and the Noisy Luau

"Humph," Paul said.  "That party is much too loud."

Grumpily, he paced in his room, wishing the neighbors would quiet down.

"I'm trying to work here," he said to no-one in particular.

He was ever so prickly, as he had not received an invite to the party, or perhaps he was just always prickly.  No one could really be sure.

"Perhaps the Armadillos did not want their friends to like me better," he conversed with himself.  He did not consider that perhaps they did not like the curmudgeonly bear.

Exasperated, the bear decided to pay his neighbors a visit wondering, "Perhaps they will let me in if I simply show up!"

As he headed over, he could smell the delicious scents emanating from the house as the music grew steadily louder.

"Invitation, please," said the butler.

"Well I haven't got one, do I?" said the prickly bear.

"I've been given strict instructions to not allow any polar bears in if they do not have an invitation."

Paul was infuriated.  He walked away wondering how he could get into this party.

"They seem to be having so much fun- and without me!"

He decided to try to jump the fence.

"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?" asked the guard.

Paul stared at the fluffy bunny.  "Exercise, I suppose?"

"Under no circumstances are exercising polar bears allowed to use the fence in this manner," said the bunny.  "You must desist now."

Paul lost it.  He charged through the fence, unable to bear the weight of a half-ton carnivore. He at the bunny, and ripped through the guests.  The silly seal, the wise walrus were the first to be eviscerated.

He caught the sneaky dog attempting to flee, and threw him into the chubby monkey.  The lazy sloth resigned itself to its fate and waited, although Paul curiously spared him.  The baby tiger did not have any more luck, and his friend, the homeless turtle was made into a stew that Paul slurped down greedily.  

The Armadillos were horrified.  Their luau was ruined! Their friends lay in heaps across the yard as pools of blood and their insides lay strewn across the grass.  Paul advanced on them.  They quickly retreated into their protective position, desperately hoping their natural armor would provide some relief from the relentless animal.

Paul picked them up and punted them into the ocean. Unable to swim, they were quickly consumed by the great-white shark that also did not like being excluded from parties.

"Wait!" they cried, "You can't come out of the water!"

"It's the thought that would have counted," he replied as they disappeared into his large mouth.

Once done with his meal, Paul returned to his home, full of his neighbors.

"Hmm, it's much too quiet now," he thought to himself.

No one really likes Paul.
